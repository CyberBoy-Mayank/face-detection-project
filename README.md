# face-detection-project

This project implements a real-time face detection system using OpenCV and MediaPipe in Python. The solution leverages MediaPipe's face detection model for efficient and accurate identification of facial features, providing robust performance across various lighting conditions and angles. OpenCV is utilized for video capture and rendering, enabling seamless real-time processing and visualization.

# Features

- **Real-Time Face Detection**: Detects faces in real-time.
- **High Accuracy**: Utilizes MediaPipe's advanced face detection model for precise facial feature identification.
- **Efficient Processing**: Optimized for low-latency performance, suitable for live applications.

# Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/CyberBoy-Mayank/face-detection-project.git
    cd face-detection-project
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

# Usage

1. Run the main script:
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```

2. The script will start capturing video from your in-built webcam and display the detected faces in real-time.
